# voiceGPT: A Voice-Interactive ChatGPT Experience

This app let's you voice interact with ChatGPT instead of typing and reading.

It's amazing how ChatGPT responds almost like a real human, right?
But don't you feel like typing your question and then reading it's answer greatly worsens this feeling of having a real human assistant?

Yep, me too!

Introducing: voiceGPT! 
Now you can just speak to ChatGPT and listen to the answer. Like real humans do when they communicate.

## üì± What it does
‚Äì Listens to your prompt (audio recording)  
‚Äì Converts your voice-prompt into text (using OpenAI's Speech-To-Text)  
‚Äì Sends your (now written) prompt to ChatGPT (using OpenAI's API)  
‚Äì Gets an answer from ChatGPT (using OpenAI's API)  
‚Äì Turns the (written) answer into speech (using OpenAI's Text-To-Speech)  
‚Äì Plays the audio file


## üåç Language Support
Tested and loved in multiple languages! While English, German, French, and Spanish sound natural, Thai might come with an amusing American accent. A delightful blend of global cultures meeting AI!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers
- **AI-Generated Responses**: Remember, the voice you hear is AI-generated. ChatGPT doesn't embody a real person. Always cross-verify crucial information.
- **Beginner's Creation**:  I'm a beginner. I made this project because I wanted to learn how to work with an API in python and how to create a GUI. This code was made for my own learning purposes and might be buggy. Use it at your own risk.
